# Is it possible to beat Bookmakers?

Context:
Bookmakers use match histories and all related data. On the other hand, they take into account the odds of their direct competitors in order to have a competitive advantage in certain matches.
The idea of this project is to see if it would be possible to create our own rating model with the data that we choose to select and then beat the bookmakers on certain bets where there is a bias.
In addition, in the case of our study, we can perform three sub-models corresponding to the home victory odds, the draw and the away victory.
